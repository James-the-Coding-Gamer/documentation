## Tables and Arrays
When working with `structured data`, use tables with `named keys` for better `performance`, `readability`, and `maintainability`
Arrays `are good` for lists of simple values, but tables `are better` for complex structured data

---

<Warning> These are  just `examples` to demonstrate faster data retrieval using tables versus arrays <br/>
Arrays have their own purpose and aren't inherently bad; they just have different use cases </Warning>

---

#### Choosing Between Tables and Arrays
Tables are `faster` than arrays for data lookups because they use a hash map internally, providing constant time lookups, making them `much more efficient`, especially for `larger datasets` <br/>
Arrays are `slower in lookups` due to linear time complexity , as they require looping through `each element` until the value is found

<Tip>`for i` loops are generally faster than `ipairs` or `pairs` *only arrays work with ipairs or for i loops*</Tip>

<CodeGroup>

```lua Good 
local job = "police"
local table = {police = true, doctor = true}
local hasJob = table[job]
```

```lua Bad
-- the larger the array the slower it gets
local array = {"police", "doctor"}
local job = "police"
local hasJob = false

for i = 1, #array do
  if array[i] == job then
    hasJob = true
    break
  end
end

```
</CodeGroup>

#### Efficient Data Structuring
When working with structured data, use `named keys` in tables to improve `readability`, `clarity`, and `performance` <br/>
Named keys allow for `easier understanding` of what each field represents, and they also enable `faster lookups` <br/>

Arrays with indexed values are `harder to read and maintain`, and lookups `are slower`, especially as the size of the data grows. 

<CodeGroup>

```lua Good  
local table = {
  {grade = 0, job = "police"}, 
  {grade = 0, job = "doctor"}  
}

local job = "police"
local hasJob = false
for i = 1, #table do
  if table[i].job == job then
    hasJob = true
    break
  end
end

```

```lua Bad

local array = {
  { 0, "police"},
  { 0,  "doctor"} 
}
local job = "police"
local hasJob = false

for i = 1, #array do
  for j = 1, #array[i] do
    if array[i][j] == job then
      hasJob = true
      break
    end
  end
   if hasJob then break end
end

```
